//Question 1
//Part One
Constant time O(1)
//Part Two
Logarithmic time O(log(n))

//Question 2
Constant time O(1)
Constant time is typically found in algorithms that access array items or complete basic arithmetic operations.

//Question 3
Polynomial time O(n^k)
Polynomial time is typically used for algorithms with nested loops.

//Question 4
Logarithmic time O(log(n))
Logarithmic time is typically used for sorted array algorithms.

//Question 5
Constant time O(1)
Constant time is used for algorithms that access array items.

//Question 6
Logarithmic time O(log(n))
Logarithmic time is used for algorithms with sorted arrays.

//Question 7
Creates an array with the same number of array items as the number entered into the function.
Linear time- as the running time is proportional to the input size.

//Question 8
Logarithmic time- as that is primarily used for sorted arrays. The running time increases slowly with larger inputs.

//Question 9
Constant time 0(1)
Constant time algorithms are used to access array items or to perform basic arithmetic operations.

//Question 10
Constant time 0(1)
Constant time algorithms are used for performing basic arithmetic.

//Question 11

-Derive an algorithm
-Implement algorithm using recursion
-Given 5 disks, what do rods look like after 7 recursive calls
-How many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 3 disks/4 disks/5 disks?
-What is the runtime of the algorithm

//Question 12
